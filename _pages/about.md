I am a Master’s graduate in Genetics from the Technical University of Munich wıth a computational focus, following my Bachelor’s in Molecular Biology and Genetics. Along the way, I joined an undergraduate research program at the University of Virginia and completed an Applied Data Science program, experiences that shaped my interest in connecting science with data and technology.

Beyond academia, I gained industry experience at Lilium, first as a Data Manager and later as a Business Analyst Intern, where I worked on projects at the intersection of data, business and AI.
